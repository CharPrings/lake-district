            <h3>Why the Lake District?</h3>
            <h2>Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain</h2>
            <p>
              Standing at 978 metres tall, Scafell Pike is England's highest
              mountain and war memorial. Thousands of people enjoy Scafell Pike
              each year, however the climb to the top should not be
              underestimated and preparation is key to a great day out.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actual height of Scafell Pike is a matter of definition or
              guesswork. The highest point is buried beneath a massive summit
              cairn over 3 metres high and it is not known how high the fabric
              of the mountain rises under the cairn. Traditionally the height
              was given as a very memorable 3,210 feet (978.4 m).
            </p>
            <p>
              Scafell Pike is one of three British peaks climbed as part of the
              National Three Peaks Challenge, and is the highest ground for over
              90 miles (145 km).

                  The Old Man of Coniston is a fell in the Furness Fells of the
                  Lake District in Cumbria, England, and is the highest point
                  (county top) of the historic county of Lancashire.[2] It is at
                  least 2,632.62 feet (802.42 m) high, and lies to the west of
                  the village of Coniston and the lake, Coniston Water.

                  A picturesque walk, over the small town of Coniston. It is one

                  metres) and you have a choice of routes.

                  Orrest Head is a hill in the English Lake District on the eastern shores of Windermere. On the summit is a panorama naming the key visible fells which include the Old Man of Coniston, Scafell Pike, Great Gable, Fairfield and the Langdale Pikes.

                <p>
                  Orrest Head is typically climbed directly from the town of Windermere near the station. Access is made via a reinstated Victorian carriageway which leads towards the summit.

                <h4>Helvellyn</h4>
                <p>
                  Helvellyn is a mountain in the English Lake District, the highest point of the Helvellyn range, a north–south line of mountains to the north of Ambleside, between the lakes of Thirlmere and Ullswater.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Helvellyn is the third-highest point both in England and in the Lake District, and access to Helvellyn is easier than to the two higher peaks of Scafell Pike and Scafell.
