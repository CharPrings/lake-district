            <h3>Why the Lake District?</h3>
            <h2>Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain</h2>
            <p>
              Standing at 978 metres tall, Scafell Pike is England's highest
              mountain and war memorial. Thousands of people enjoy Scafell Pike
              each year, however the climb to the top should not be
              underestimated and preparation is key to a great day out.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actual height of Scafell Pike is a matter of definition or
              guesswork. The highest point is buried beneath a massive summit
              cairn over 3 metres high and it is not known how high the fabric
              of the mountain rises under the cairn. Traditionally the height
              was given as a very memorable 3,210 feet (978.4 m).
            </p>
            <p>
              Scafell Pike is one of three British peaks climbed as part of the
              National Three Peaks Challenge, and is the highest ground for over
              90 miles (145 km).
